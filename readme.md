A place where I drop my algorithms, code snippets, and algorithms implementations.
Basically it will serve as a playground and to review programming in the future.

Every project is contained in a single file, or a folder. And they're enumerated in the following list:

## FizzBuzz
	My first attempt to write a FizzbBuzz, just for the memes.

## RecursiveFizzBuzz
	A tail recursive function.

## GenericBinaryTree
	A binary tree that is generic.

## ExceptionsAsynchronousTask
	Shows how to handle an exception that is raised in a asynchronous awaited method.
