## Patchy
![](img/patchy_back.png)

A place where I drop my algorithms, code snippets, and algorithms implementations.
Basically it will serve as a playground and to review programming in the future.

## Source

Every project is contained in a single file, or a folder. And they're enumerated in the following list:

## FizzBuzz

<a href="https://github.com/yureru/Patchy/blob/master/source/FizzBuzz.cs"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yureru/Patchy/master/img/Sheet.png"/></a>

	My first attempt to write a FizzbBuzz, just for the memes.

## RecursiveFizzBuzz
	A tail recursive function.

## GenericBinaryTree
	A binary tree that is generic.

## ExceptionsAsynchronousTask
	Shows how to handle an exception that is raised in a asynchronous awaited method.
